# Pixi_Test

The goal of this project was to learn about the PIXI library by making responsive minigames.
The first one is Conway's Game of Life (click the on the cells to change their state and click the red button to start or stop the simulation) and is responsive on reload. The second one is fully responsive, the goal is to complete the magic square (the sum of the numbers in every row, colomm and diagonal must be equal).
