# Pixi_Test

The goal of this project was to learn about the PIXI library in preparation for a gamejam.
I wanted to learn basic image handling, how to make a drag & drop and how to adapt to multiple resolutions (only the magic square game handle resizing though)
I also tried to make an API more similar to what I'm used to when working on games.
